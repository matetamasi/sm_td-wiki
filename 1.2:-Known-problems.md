## Three fingers roll

If you press 3 keys simultaneously, smtd will interpret this as hold + hold + tap (read 3.3: Deep Explanation: Three keys and states stack). That's what's  usually expected in 99% of the cases, but anyway, that breaks fast typing that involves 3 or more finger rolls. It will be fixed in verison v.1.1.0.


## Rattle modification key with Mods Recall feature

For example, you hit `↓shift` (that is not a part of smtd), `↓smtd_macro`, `↑shift` and `↑smtd_macro`. The actual tap of smtd_macro wouldn't be sent to OS until you physically release that key. So the OS will receive the following sequence: `↓shift`, `↑shift` (from physically pressing and releasing shift key), then `↓shift` (from mod recall), `↓↑smtd_macro_tap_action` and `↑shift`. Some programs (like Intellij IDEA) may interpret double shift press as a shortcut for some actions, leading to unexpected behavior when using Mods Recall.

To overcome that issue, you should make your shift modifier an smtd macro, so when smtd resolves keypresses, it would be able to correctly handle intercepting states for the two keys. 


## Twice quantum key processing before users code

When you press a key there are many layers involved in handling that press:
- quantum's process_record()
- keyboard's process_record_keyboard()
- users process_record_user() (the one we write in keymap.c)
- post user processing in keyboard layer
- post keyboard processing in quantum
- final decision to send a key press to OS

The problem is that sm_td suspends key handling execution in the user's layer and later emulates key pressing or releasing. The library uses quantum process_record() function to generate key presses and releases. So with single tap there will be such situation:

- user presses a key
- quantum layer runs process_record() for press
- keyboard layer runs process_record_keyboard() for press
- user layer runs process_record_user() for press
- sm_td blocks further execution and nothing is sent to OS

- user releases a key
- quantum layer runs process_record() for release
- keyboard layer runs process_record_keyboard() for release
- user layer runs process_record_user() for release
- sm_td interpret that as a tap, so it reruns process_record for press
  - quantum layer runs process_record() for press
  - keyboard layer runs process_record_keyboard() for press
  - user layer runs process_record_user() for press
  - sm_td passes execution since it recognized that as a tap 
  - post user processing in keyboard layer for press
  - post keyboard processing in quantum for press
  - send a key press to OS
- sm_td passes release
- post user processing in keyboard layer for release
- post keyboard processing in quantum for release
- send a key release to OS

So as you see there is extra execution for process_record() and process_record_keyboard(). It's not big deal, if you don't use sm_td keys for anything else. I didn't notice any visible consequences for that behaviour, but there could be some side effects for core libraries (like caps word, I guess), so if you find any bugs related to this, please create an issue in github here.
